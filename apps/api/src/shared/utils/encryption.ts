/**
 * The single place that turns a Worker environment into an encryption policy.
 *
 * `@makanmasak/utils` owns the cryptography and stays environment-agnostic: its
 * `encrypt`/`decrypt` take a `requireStrongKey` flag with no default, so every
 * call site has to state whether a missing or guessable `ENCRYPTION_KEY` is
 * fatal. This module is where that answer is computed for `apps/api`, exactly
 * once, from `NODE_ENV`.
 *
 * Production-only, and deliberately so. `apps/api/.dev.vars` ships no
 * `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and the test fixtures use short placeholders like
 * `"test-encryption-key"`; a blanket guard would break local dev and every
 * existing fixture without protecting anything, because those environments hold
 * no real customer secrets. This mirrors `assertEmailChannelAvailable` in
 * `features/customer/routes/index.ts`, which lets the noop mail provider through
 * outside production and refuses to pretend in it.
 *
 * Production is what matters: `makanmasak-api-prod` has no `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
 * secret at all, and without this flag PBKDF2 over an empty string plus the
 * hardcoded salts below yields an AES-256 key that any reader of this
 * repository can recompute (issue #300).
