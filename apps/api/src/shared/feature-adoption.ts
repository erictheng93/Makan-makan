/**
 * Which features are built but not launched, declared in code.
 *
 * Several capabilities are fully implemented, mounted and reachable in
 * production while nobody uses them. Until this registry existed the only way
 * to find that out was to query the production database and count rows, so the
 * answer to "is this live?" lived nowhere a reader could see it. That is what
 * this fixes: the state is declared here, served from /info, and covered by
 * tests that stop it drifting away from the routes it describes.
 *
 * `enabledByDefault` is the deliberate part. A feature is only defaulted off
 * when affected UI reads the same availability signal and hides its control
 * before the request. Where a working UI calls the endpoints and has not been
 * connected to that signal, the default stays on: silently 404ing a screen
 * someone is looking at is worse than the screen being pointless.
