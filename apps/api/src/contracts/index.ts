/**
 * API Response Contract Schemas — Central Barrel Export
 *
 * These schemas define the STABLE response shapes for all API endpoints.
 * Frontend clients depend on these shapes. Any change here is a potential
 * breaking change and should be reviewed carefully.
 *
 * Usage in contract tests:
 *   import { AuthContracts } from "../../contracts";
 *   assertMatchesSchema(AuthContracts.LoginResponse, actualResponse);
 *
 * Usage in breaking change detection:
 *   The scripts/check-api-contracts.cjs script imports these schemas
 *   and generates JSON snapshots for CI diffing.
