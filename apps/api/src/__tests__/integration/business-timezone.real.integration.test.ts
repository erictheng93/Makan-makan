/**
 * Real-D1 cover for #329: the business day is cut at the restaurant's own
 * midnight, not at a hardcoded +08.
 *
 * The symptom this replaces is a night market's whole evening landing on the
 * wrong day. A GMT+9 shop's 00:30 order was bucketed as 23:30 the day before,
 * and a GMT+7 shop's 23:30 order as the day after — so the owner's daily
 * revenue disagreed with the till and the timezone they had picked was
 * displayed back to them intact the whole time.
 *
 * This has to run against real D1: the bucketing is SQLite date arithmetic, so
 * a mocked drizzle cannot tell an offset that is threaded through from one
 * that is ignored. Every assertion below flips if `dateFromUnixMs` goes back
 * to a constant '+8 hours'.
