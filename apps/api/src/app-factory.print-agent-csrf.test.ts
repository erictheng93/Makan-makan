/**
 * The local print agent is a Node daemon on the shop floor, not a browser. It
 * holds no session cookie and undici sends neither Origin nor Referer, so both
 * CSRF layers reject it before the handler runs: layer 1 answers
 * INVALID_REQUEST_ORIGIN on the missing Origin, and layer 2 would answer
 * CSRF_TOKEN_MISSING after it.
 *
 * That kills the only path that settles a print job. The agent claims a
 * receipt (print_status -> "printing"), prints it, and then cannot acknowledge
 * the outcome — every receipt stays claimed forever with no reclaim path, and
 * the cloud never learns whether paper came out.
 *
 * The agent authenticates by possession of PRINT_AGENT_API_KEY, checked in the
 * route itself, which is the same shape as the webhook exclusions above it.
