/**
 * Per-(restaurant, IP) throttle for guest order creation.
 *
 * Layered *on top of* the global per-IP limiter in geo-rate-limiting, not a
 * replacement for it. Re-keying the global limiter by restaurant would have
 * made abuse cheaper, not dearer: one IP capped at N/min overall becomes one IP
 * capped at N/min *per restaurant*, so an attacker just spreads across stalls.
 * Keeping both means the global cap still bounds the total while this one bounds
 * what any single stall can be made to absorb — a night market's order printer
 * is the thing that actually falls over.
 *
 * Deliberately not keyed on anything derived from the shop QR code. That code is
 * public: `GET /api/v1/restaurants/:id` and the discovery takeaway-eligibility
 * endpoint both hand it to anyone who asks, by design, so customers can start a
 * takeaway order from discovery without physically scanning. Treating it as
 * proof of presence would be security theatre (see issue #187).
 *
 * IP is a blunt key and this repo has been burned by it before: keying the
 * active-order lock on IP took out QR ordering for every customer behind a
 * restaurant's shared WiFi (#163-#168). Two things keep that from repeating —
 * the budget is per stall rather than shared across the whole venue, and
 * exceeding it costs a 429 with Retry-After for the rest of the window rather
 * than an escalating block.
